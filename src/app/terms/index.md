**Schedule A**

**Zift Service Level Agreement**

This Zift Service Level Agreement (**“Service Level Agreement”** or **“SLA”**) outlines the service level performance targets applicable to the Zift Platform.

1. **Definitions**
2. **“Downtime”** means that the Zift Platform are offline and unavailable for the Customer’s use. Downtime excludes downtime and unavailability resulting directly or indirectly from any Service Level Exclusion.
3. **“Monthly Uptime Percentage”** means the total number of minutes in a calendar month minus the number of minutes of Downtime suffered in such calendar month, divided by the total number of minutes in the calendar month. The applicable formula is:
 
    **Monthly Uptime Percentage = ((Total Minutes in Month – Total Minutes of Downtime) / Total Minutes in Month)	X 100**

    For any partial calendar month during which the applicable Customer has access to the Zift Platform, the Monthly Uptime Percentage shall be calculated based on the entire calendar month, not just the portion for which the Customer has access to the Zift Platform. The determination of whether the Zift Platform is available will be made in good faith by Zift based on monitoring performed by Zift.

4. **“Service Level Credit”** means the credit provided by Zift in accordance with Section 2 (Subscription Service Availability and Credits) below.
5. **“Service Level Exclusions”** Downtime does not include unavailability, suspension or termination of the Zift Platform that result from: (a) termination or suspension of the Zift Platform described in Section 10.4 (Suspension of Services) of the Agreement; (b) factors outside of Zift’s reasonable control, including force majeure events, denial of service attacks, or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of Zift and its third party hosting providers; (c) any actions or inactions of Customer or any third party; (d) Customer infrastructure, equipment, software or other technology and/or third party equipment, software or other technology or Customer’s use of the Zift Platform in a manner inconsistent with the Documentation; (e) any scheduled maintenance of the Zift Platform occurring in the ordinary course of business; (f) Zift’s suspension and termination of a Customer’s right to use the Zift Platform in accordance with the Agreement; or (g) license restrictions or other limitations as set forth in each Order Form.

1. **Subscription Service Availability and Credits**
2. **Service Levels.** Zift will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Zift Platform available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.5% during any calendar month (the **“Availability Service Level”**). In the event Zift does not meet the Standard Availability Service Level (a **“Service Level Failure”**), Customer will be eligible to receive a Service Level Credit as described below.

    **Standard Service Levels**

    | Monthly Uptime Percentage | Service Level Credit Percentage |
    | Less than 99.5% but equal to or greater than 98.5% | 5% |
    | Less than 98.5% but equal to or greater than 97.5% | 10% |
    | Less than 97.5% but equal to or greater than 96% | 20% |
    | Less than 96% | 30% |

3. **Calculation of the Credit.** Service Level Credits are calculated by multiplying (x) the applicable Service Level Credit Percentage by (y) the product of the total annual Subscription Fees (as defined in an Order Form) actually paid by Customer to Zift for the Zift Platform under an affected Order Form divided by twelve (12) months.
4. **Maximum Service Level Credit.** The Service Level Credits awarded in any month shall not, under any circumstance, exceed thirty percent (30%) of the total Subscription Fees actually paid by Customer to Zift for access to the Zift Platform under the affected Order Form for the affected month.

1. **Service Level Credit Request and Payment Procedures**
2. **Requesting a Service Level Credit.** To receive a Service Level Credit, Customer must submit a claim by email to service@ziftsolutions.com (a **“Service Level Credit Request”**). To be eligible, the Service Level Credit Request must be received by Zift within ninety (90) days of the occurrence of the Service Level Failure and must include: (a) the words “Service Level Credit Request” in the subject line; and (b) the dates and times of each Service Level Failure that Customer is claiming, including the dates and times of the Downtime that caused the Service Level Failure.
3. **Issuance of Service Level Credits.** If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such request is confirmed by Zift and is less than the applicable Availability Service Level, then Zift will issue the Service Level Credit to Customer within thirty (30) days following the month in which Customer’s request is confirmed by Zift. Customer’s failure to provide the request and other information as required above will disqualify Customer from receiving a Service Level Credit. Zift will notify Customer of the amount of any Service Level Credit, which shall be applied against future amounts owed by Customer. Service Level Credits will not entitle Customer to any refund or other payment from Zift. Service Level Credits are not payable in cash and will only be applied against future amounts owed by Customer to Zift.
4. **Sole and Exclusive Remedy.** The Service Level Credit is Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy and Zift’s sole and exclusive liability for a Service Level Failure.
5. Notwithstanding the above, should Zift fail to achieve at least 95% general availability over two consecutive calendar quarters, Customer shall have the option to terminate the Services for cause, in which case Zift will refund to Customer any prepaid fees for the remainder of its Term after the effective date of termination.

**Schedule B**

**Data Processing Agreement**

    24. Customer agrees that (i) it shall comply with its obligations as a Data Controller under Data Protection Laws in respect of its Processing of Personal Data and any Processing instructions it issues to Zift; and (ii) it has provided notice and obtained all consents and rights necessary under Data Protection Laws for Zift to Process Personal Data and provide the Services. Customer shall immediately notify Zift and cease Processing Personal Data in the event any required authorization or legal basis for Processing is revoked or terminates.
    25. Zift shall Process Personal Data only for the purposes described in the Agreement or in accordance with Customer’s other documented lawful instructions unless Processing is required by applicable law, in which case Zift shall to the extent permitted by applicable laws inform Customer of that legal requirement before the relevant Processing. Customer hereby instructs Zift to Process Personal Data as necessary in order to provide and improve the Services, to fulfill its obligations under the Agreement and this DPA, and for legitimate purposes relating to the operation, support and/or use of the Services such as billing, account management, and technical support.
    26. The details of the Processing of Personal Data, including the subject matter, duration, nature, and purposes of the Processing; the categories of Data Subjects; and the types of Personal Data are set forth in **Schedule 1** to this DPA.
27. **Data Security.** Each Party shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures against unauthorized or unlawful Processing of Personal Data or its accidental loss, destruction, or damage. Zift shall implement and maintain commercially reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect Personal Data from Data Breaches, to help ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Personal Data and Processing systems, in accordance with Zift’s security standards, including, the security measures described in **Schedule 2** to this DPA. Notwithstanding the above, Customer agrees that it is responsible for its secure use of the Services, including securing its account authentication credentials, protecting the security of Personal Data when in transit, and taking any appropriate steps to securely encrypt or backup Personal Data, as well as the security obligations outlined in the Agreement.
28. **Data Breach Response.** Zift shall notify Customer without undue delay and no later than 48 hours after becoming aware of any Data Breach. Zift shall make reasonable efforts to identify the cause of the Data Breach and shall undertake such steps as Zift deems necessary and reasonable in order to remediate the cause of such Data Breach. Zift shall provide information related to the Data Breach as it becomes available to Customer in a timely fashion and as reasonably necessary for Customer to maintain compliance with Data Protection Laws.
29. **Confidentiality of Data Processing.** Zift shall ensure that any person who is authorized by Zift to Process Personal Data (including its staff, agents, and subcontractors) shall be under an appropriate obligation of confidentiality.
30. **Return or Deletion of Data.** Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, Zift shall (at Customer’s election) delete or return, if feasible, to Customer all Personal Data remaining in its possession or control, save that this requirement shall not apply: (i) to the extent Zift is required by applicable law to retain some or all of the Personal Data; (ii) if Zift is Processing the Personal Data on behalf of an Authorized Partner acting as a co-Data Controller pursuant to a separate data protection agreement; or (iii) to Personal Data Zift has archived on back-up systems, which will be deleted in accordance with Zift’s standard data retention policies and procedures. In all such cases, Zift shall maintain the Personal Data securely and limit Processing to the purposes that prevent deletion or return of the Personal Data. The terms of this DPA shall survive for so long as Zift continues to retain any Personal Data.
31. **Sub-processing.** Customer agrees that this DPA constitutes Customer’s written general authorization for Zift to engage Sub-processors to Process Personal Data on Customer’s behalf, including the **Sub-processors**. Zift shall: (i) take commercially reasonable measures to ensure that Sub-processors have the requisite capabilities to Process Personal Data in accordance with this DPA; (ii) enter into a written agreement with the Sub-processor imposing data protection terms that require the Sub-processor to protect the Personal Data to the standard required by Data Protection Laws; (iii) remain responsible for its compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of the Sub-processor that cause Zift to breach any of its obligations under this DPA; and (iv) notify Customer in the event that it intends to engage different or additional Sub-processors that will Process Personal Data pursuant to this DPA, which may be done by email or through another mechanism made available by Zift to Customer that enables Customer to receive such notifications. Customer must raise any objection to such Sub-processors within thirty (30) calendar days of Zift’s notification. Customer’s objection shall only be effective if submitted to Zift in writing, specifically describing Customer’s reasonable belief that Zift’s proposed use of the Sub-processor(s) will materially, adversely affect Customer’s compliance with applicable Data Protection Laws. In any such case, the parties will make reasonable efforts to reconcile the matter. In the event Customer’s concern cannot be resolved, Zift may terminate the Agreement with no penalty and Customer shall immediately pay all fees and costs accrued or payable to Zift prior to the effective date of termination.
32. **International Transfers.**
    33. Zift may Process Personal Data anywhere in the world where Zift or its Sub-processors maintain data Processing operations. Zift shall at all times provide an adequate level of protection for the Personal Data Processed, in accordance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws.

        35. Customer is the “data exporter” and Zift is the “data importer.”
        36. For the purpose of Section II, Clause 8.1, the Agreement and this DPA constitute the final and complete instructions to Zift for the Processing of Personal Data as of the date of this DPA. Any additional or alternate instructions must be mutually agreed upon separately in writing and signed by both parties.

        41. Annex I is deemed to be completed with the details set out in **Schedule 1** to this DPA.
        42. Annex II (Technical and Organisational Measures Including Technical and Organisational Measures to Ensure the Security of the Data) is deemed to be completed with the Technical and Organizational Security Measures set out in Schedule 2 to this DPA.
        43. If and to the extent an EEA Restricted Transfer involves Personal Data originating from Switzerland and is subject to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection of 19 June 1992 (the “FADP”), the EU Standard Contractual Clauses are deemed to be supplemented with an additional annex that provides as follows:
    44. for purposes of Clause 13 and Annex I.C, the competent Supervisory Authority is the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner;
    45. the term “member state” as used in the EU Standard Contractual Clauses must not be interpreted in such a way as to exclude Data Subjects in Switzerland from the possibility of suing for their rights in their place of habitual residence (Switzerland) in accordance with Clause 18.c;
    46. references in the EU Standard Contractual Clauses to the GDPR should be understood as references to the FADP; and
    47. until entry into force of the revised FADP of 25 September 2020, the EU Standard Contractual Clauses also protect the data of legal entities.
        48. In the event of any conflict between this DPA and the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, the EU Standard Contractual Clauses will prevail with respect to any EEA Restricted Transfer.
    49. To the extent Zift’s performance or Customer’s use of the Services requires the transfer of Personal Data from within the United Kingdom to the United States or any other country that has not been designated by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data (a “UK Restricted Transfer”), the terms of this Section 3 will apply.
        50. When the parties are lawfully permitted to rely on the UK Standard Contractual Clauses to conduct the UK Restricted Transfer, Zift hereby enters into the UK Standard Contractual Clauses, which are incorporated by reference herein, with Customer. For the purpose of any such UK Restricted Transfer, the UK Standard Contractual Clauses will be completed as follows:
        51. Customer will be considered the “Data Exporter” and Zift will be considered the “Data Importer.”
        52. References in the UK Standard Contractual Clauses to “the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established” shall hereby be deemed to mean “the law of the United Kingdom”; and any other obligation in the UK Standard Contractual Clauses determined by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established shall hereby be deemed to refer to an obligation under UK data protection laws.
        53. The details of Appendix 1 are set forth in Schedule 1.
        54. The details of Appendix 2 are set forth in Schedule 2.
            55.

For the purpose of any such UK Restricted Transfer, the EU Standard Contractual Clauses will be completed as set forth in Section 9.2, subject to the amendments specified by the UK Addendum.
            56. When neither Section 3.1 nor Section 9.3.2 of this Addendum apply, then Zift shall cooperate with Customer to promptly implement appropriate safeguards for the UK Restricted Transfer as required or permitted by the UK GDPR.
    57. Data Protection Authority Inquiries. Zift shall provide commercially reasonable cooperation to assist Customer in its response to any requests from data protection authorities with authority relating to the Processing of Personal Data under the Agreement and this DPA. In the event that any such request is made directly to Zift, Zift shall not respond to such communication directly without Customer’s prior authorization, unless legally compelled to do so. If Zift is required to respond to such a request, Zift shall promptly notify Customer and provide it with a copy of the request unless legally prohibited from doing so.
    58. Individual Rights and Requests. To the extent Customer does not have the ability to independently correct, amend, or delete Personal Data, or block or restrict Processing of Personal Data, then at Customer’s written direction and to the extent required by Data Protection Laws, Zift shall comply with any commercially reasonable request by Customer to facilitate such actions. To the extent legally permitted, Customer shall be responsible for any costs arising from Zift’s or its Sub-processors’ provision of such assistance.

        62. Zift shall cooperate with audits and inspections performed by Customer or a vendor of Customer reasonably acceptable to Zift that are necessary to confirm Zift’s compliance with this DPA, provided however, that any such audit or inspection: (i) may not be performed unless necessary to determine Zift’s compliance with this DPA and Customer reasonably believes that Zift is not complying with this DPA; (ii) must be conducted at Customer’s sole expense and subject to reasonable fees and costs charged by Zift; (iii) conducted at a date and time and for a duration mutually agreed by the parties; and (v) must be performed in a manner that does not cause any damage, injury, or disruption to Zift’s premises, equipment, personnel, or business.

Customer shall not exercise its rights under this Section more than once per year.
    63. Law Enforcement and Other Governmental Requests. If a law enforcement or other governmental agency sends Zift a demand for Personal Data (for example, through a subpoena or court order), Zift may attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that data directly from Customer. As part of this effort, Zift may provide Customer’s basic contact information to the law enforcement agency. If compelled to disclose Personal Data to a law enforcement agency, then Zift shall give Customer reasonable notice of the demand to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless Zift is legally prohibited from doing so. Zift will not voluntarily disclose Personal Data in response to a request or demand from a law enforcement or governmental agency unless compelled to do so by applicable law to which Zift is subject.
    64. Customer Obligations. Customer shall ensure that Customer is entitled to transfer the relevant Personal Data to Zift so that Zift may lawfully use, process, and transfer the Personal Data in accordance with the Agreement on the Customer’s behalf, and acknowledges that Zift is reliant on Customer for direction as to the extent to which Zift is entitled to use and process Personal Data.
