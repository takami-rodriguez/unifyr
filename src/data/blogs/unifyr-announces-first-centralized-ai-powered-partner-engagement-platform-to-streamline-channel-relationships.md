[View the original press release on Business Wire.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250324550049/en/Unifyr-Announces-First-Centralized-AI-Powered-Partner-Engagement-Platform-to-Streamline-Channel-Relationships)

CARY, N.C.—(BUSINESS WIRE)—Unifyr today announced the launch of Unifyr+, a platform that addresses the challenges of modern channel relationships by putting channel partners in the driver's seat, leveraging traditional vendor-centric partner relationship management (PRM) programs via a partner-first platform. The new solution empowers managed service providers (MSPs) and other partners to expand their reach, improve engagement, and enhance their position in the multi-vendor world.

_Unifyr delivers the only platform built for the entire ecosystem, boosting channel partner engagement with a streamlined experience in a multi-vendor world._

The platform provides a centralized hub for managing and accessing vendor content, leads, deals, training, and events with one single login. Unifyr+ is built on ZiftONE, extending the value of existing PRM investments by expanding the reach to offer new opportunities for visibility and growth. The company will launch and demonstrate the Unifyr+ capabilities at the Channel Partners Conference and Expo, taking place March 24–27, 2025, at The Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.

“Unifyr+ redefines how partners can thrive in an increasingly diverse and complex channel ecosystem,” said Tobias Hartmann, Unifyr CEO. “Traditional PRM platforms have created a visibility asymmetry, where vendors have insight into their partner networks, while partners often deal with multiple portals and log-ins. Unifyr+ inverts this model and brings the channel together profitably by providing a centralized hub where partners can efficiently manage multiple vendor relationships. We are introducing the only platform built for the entire ecosystem, boosting partner engagement with a streamlined experience while making sure the partners’ brands stay top-of-mind.”

Key Benefits of Unifyr+ include:

- Program Discovery simplifies the process of establishing, maintaining, and engaging in new and existing vendor relationships.
- Single Point Discovery of content, events, and training across vendors eliminates the need to log into multiple partner platforms.
- Centralized Lead and Deal Registration allows users to track lead and deal registrations across vendors, providing a comprehensive view of their pipeline.
- The AI-Powered Advisor allows users to quickly source vendor materials, using natural language to provide instant answers and strategies without time-consuming searches, emails, or training sessions.
