Market Development Funds (MDF) are financial incentives offered by vendors to channel partners to
help fund marketing activities that promote the vendor’s products and solutions. These funds are
typically allocated based on partner performance, sales volume, or specific strategic initiatives.
Example: A cybersecurity vendor might provide MDF to a managed service provider (MSP) to host a
webinar on cybersecurity threats and promote its solution.

    content marketing).
4.  **Reimbursement & Reporting** – Partners submit proof of activity (receipts, analytics, ROI
    metrics) to claim reimbursement.
